# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to analyze sentiment in tweets to classify them as **positive** or **negative** using Machine Learning techniques. It demonstrates a comprehensive pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw Twitter data for analysis.
- **Text Feature Extraction**: Leveraging techniques such as **TF-IDF** for meaningful text representation.
- **Classification Models**: Training and evaluating algorithms like Logistic Regression.
- **Visualizations**: Presenting insights through data plots and result summaries.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenizing text
   - Removing special characters, stopwords, and URLs
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Applying vectorization methods for numerical representation
3. **Model Training**:
   - Training multiple classifiers and tuning hyperparameters
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Analyzing model performance using metrics like accuracy
5. **Visualization**:
